## obstacle-avoiding-bot

## Background

I have been making arduino projects for sbout 3 years now, i really wanted to learn and make using the ESP-32 Board,
Since this is my first ever ESP-32 project, I am keeping it simple with just a obstacle avoiding robot, but i will make 
this remote controlled using the inbuilt bluetooth chip and also make it accessable/useable from anywhere using the wifi 
chip integrated in it, I am planning to make a web-app myself, which is my upcoming project. I will update the web-app 
here only so stay tuned. Now, about the current project,

# Components used:

1. 1x ESP-32 development board
2. 2x L298N motor drivers
3. 1x SRF-04 ultrasonic sensor
4. 4x BO motors
5. 4x BO motor wheels
6. 1x breadboard
7. 3x 18650 li-ion battery
8. 1x breadboard mini (to keep the wiring clean)


## 3d model

In the 3d model all i have done is made how the components will be placed into the base of the bot (which i will custom make
out of paper to keep it light weight), since I am new to 3d modelling this is the best output could provide for the time 
consumed.

## Schematics

In the schematics i have done the main wiring of the bot , since I am also new to schematics design the components are a bit 
scattered here and there, hope no one minds ðŸ˜…
