## 10/18/2025 - First 3d model  

I have created my first ever 3d model in my entire life, although I have not done the schematics for this project yet, I have made a 3d model laying out how the components will be placed in the main frame and also if you are wondering why is there those circular things instead of a flat plane as a base its cause, I don't have a flat surface to mount everything to and I don't have a 3d printer to print it so I made paper rolls and glued them to use as my baseplate so that's![Screenshot 2025-10-18 113833.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjkxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--17f48b24e445ab47a014a664437d069f1e8f96aa/Screenshot%202025-10-18%20113833.png)

## 10/28/2025 - finished the schematics   

I just completed the schematics for the first time and now I am waiting for my brother who is an electrical engineer to review the schematics and make sure the connections are correct and will be functional ![Screenshot 2025-10-28 121652](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjE3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--75a1fc6db997687596e7b83facc3b81b1f769168/Screenshot%202025-10-28%20121652.png)
